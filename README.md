## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (for color readability)
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned how to select individual table rows using nth-child. I got some practice using fetch, async functions and promises. I learned that I needed to run a dev server to access a local JSON file without getting a CORS error, and that led me to learn that there is a handy VSCOde extension for that called Live Server. Life changing info.

### Continued development

I'd like to learn more best-practices for organizing stylesheets. I keep trying different things, but I'd like to know what the best-practices or conventions are for that and also for class names.
